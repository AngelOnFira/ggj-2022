You want excitement, to see what's out there in the world. It has to be more exciting than this. You've heard tells of a wise hermit, a retired adventurer, living just through the forest. One bright and sunny day you pack your bags, hug your family, take your family locket and some food, and make your way to the forest."

You follow the road past some worn down houses on the outskirts of town; nobody lives here anymore. You used to play here with your brother when you were younger, but he grew up. He became part of the village guard, and warned her away from these houses.

\"All sorts out there,\" he'd say. \"It's not as safe as it was.\""

You're all set, but you feel so unprepared."
